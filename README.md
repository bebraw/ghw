# ghw - Converts your Github wiki to gh-pages

This tool makes it possible for you to serve the content of your Github wiki pages using gh-pages. This allows you to customize the UI and aggregate information (ie. localized versions) within the same site.

## Dependencies

* [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked)
* [Mu](https://github.com/raycmorgan/Mu)
* [commander.js](https://github.com/visionmedia/commander.js)
* [suite.js](https://github.com/bebraw/suite.js)

You can use "sudo npm install marked mu2 commander suite.js" to install these. Note that you won't need commander.js if you use ghw as a module. Also suite.js is optional (needed by tests).

## Thanks
