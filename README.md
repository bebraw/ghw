# ghw - Converts your Github wiki to gh-pages

This tool makes it possible for you to serve the content of your Github wiki pages using gh-pages. This allows you to customize the UI and aggregate information (ie. localized versions) within the same site.

Depends on marked (https://github.com/chjj/marked) and Mu (https://github.com/raycmorgan/Mu). Use "sudo npm install marked mu2" to install these.
