# ghw - Converts your Github wiki to gh-pages

This tool makes it possible for you to serve the content of your Github wiki pages using gh-pages. This allows you to customize the UI and aggregate information (ie. localized versions) within the same site.

## Dependencies

* [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked)
* [hogan](http://twitter.github.com/hogan.js/)
* [commander.js](https://github.com/visionmedia/commander.js)
* [suite.js](https://github.com/bebraw/suite.js)
* [funkit](https://github.com/bebraw/funkit)

You can use "sudo npm install" to install the dependencies locally. After that you should be able to run the tests (lib/tests.js)
